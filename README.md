# Dream
Hello,

Am, How are you? How is your health? I couldn't ask you.
definitely sure that you are bitter without me you feel meditation that I'm away. I'm sorry for being the reason for your tears and sadness.
and also sorry for you reading this. I just wanna you to know that you're strongly still in my mind and still thinking about you really deeply.

you won't understand how far it's but what happened today with me is saying a lot...

your voice still echoing in my ear your words your laugh. I just running myself cause I'm the reason

do u remember your song "Have I Told You Lately..." that's the only thing that I have from your voice

and maybe you forgot about it. but I have it I could stay alive all that time just using 3 minutes of your voice.

Wow. I just discovered how weak I am without you. Girl you're part of me like my heart. Girl, you are my heart

remember how everything was wonderful and perfect. How we were planning for our days how we cared about each other

little Korean part. where you came from and how you took all that space in me when all this happened. I have no feeling with the days anymore

in drunk mode since that time.

I'm just writing this to tell you that you are still with me in a weird crazy way.

I just had a dream I saw myself entering a house and your mom your younger sister and your father it was weird.

you kind of felt odd that I was there. and then your father was showing me something on his PC and he needed someone to speak my language to translate something for him.

and then you looked at me and gave me a sign to tell me to ask him what he was doing then I did. I found him so happy and he was telling me in a very passionate way.

and also I spoke with your sister about her husband. She was a little sad I tried to support her.

and I think it was late around 3 pm so you decided to keep me at home that night

and then I keep using my phone till I slept.

that was crazy.
